							<h2>Cybersecurity:</h2>

							<p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
							<p>“Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.” (kaspersky.com.au) The term cybersecurity can refer to different contexts, ranging from business to mobile computing. As an evolving society that mostly relies on computers for many purposes, users are more prone to cyber threats than ever whether in a business context to a mobile computing context. There are a plethora of securities that help in defending a computer system and these include the network security which practices in preventing intruders from entering and spreading in your network. To give an example of this are firewalls. “Application security is the process of making apps more secure by finding, fixing and enhancing the security of apps.” (csoonline.com) Today, there are many apps developed to secure the software on a system, and to illustrate an application that performs the process is vmware appdefense. Information security is a set of practices that ensures that stored data is secured as well as transferred data from one machine to another. Finally, operational security is a process whereby managers of a corporation look into the perspective of attackers in order to keep confidential information secured and away from the wrong hands.

							<p><b>What can be done now?/What can be done in three years?</b></p>
							<p>As of right now, to protect yourself from cyber crimes and attacks, install an antivirus software. Do not click on email attachments from people you do not know as well as remove messages from people you do not know. Also, make sure to download and buy software from trustworthy sources and ensure that your password is strong; a unique combination of letters, numbers and case types. Achieving all of the above will guarantee safety from cyber attacks.The future of cyberspace is inextricably linked “to the future of information technology and the advancements of cyberspace.” (forbes.com) Without a doubt, the role of cyber will be larger than ever in our personal and business lives due to the society heavily relying on technology for completely any purpose. Many businesses, if not, all businesses utilise technology to complete any function required in their respective purposes. For instance, technology includes computers, the wifi, etc. and applying these just causes the majority of the world to be more prone to attacks. "Cybersecurity experts predict that in 2021 there will be a cyber attack incident every 11 seconds. This is nearly twice what it was in 2019 (every 19 seconds), and four times the rate five years ago (every 40 seconds in 2016)” - Robert McKay, senior vice president at Neustar. Therefore, it is predicted that in about 3 years time to many more years, it will become more and more frequent and so from small businesses to corporations would need to retaliate to this crime by possessing firmer security.

							<p><b>What technological or other developments make this possible?</b></p>
							<p>Blockchain cybersecurity is one of the latest technologies in cybersecurity that is rapidly gaining traction and recognition. Blockchain technology works on the basis of identification of two transaction parties. All members of the blockchain are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the data included. In addition, blockchains prevent loss in data from hackers and is currently the most secure security, described as a ‘near-impenetrable’. As a result, using blockchain in the company of artificial intelligence can demonstrate a robust verification system to keep potential cyber threats away. Nowadays, artificial intelligence will frequently be relied upon in both cyber attack and defense. As an AI can be programmed to develop skills to spot patterns of coincidence or behavior, this can be applied to in a cybersecurity context. It can learn to adjust itself to signal attempted attacks and will continue to retain this skill/behavior. As the years go by, AI’s will evolve to defend incoming attacks much more simpler and become more accessible.
							</p>

							<p><b>What is the likely impact?</p></b>
							<p>Even if AI’s are used for both cyber attack and defense and it is much more effective compared to using softwares and taking other measures, cyber security will never die out. This is primarily due to security being more dynamic, and criminals also having access to AI’s to carry out new attacks that never existed before. For instance, people can use lasers to trick Amazon Echo or Google Home into thinking you are talking to it is an example of why AI’s can be viewed as ‘untrustworthy’ sometimes. Moreover, there will be more sophisticated emerging threats that will become more apparent over the years as technology progresses and so, a lacking program by a staff of cyber security will put you in a predicament. So, as long as people continue to communicate, share, make online purchases, etc. criminals will take action. This also holds true for businesses, both small and large. Therefore, the cybersecurity job growth is looking very strong and in high demand presently, hence, creating new jobs such as programming robots to defend against cyber crimes, network security, security architecture, and so forth.
							</p>

							<p><b>How will this affect you?</p></b>
							<p>I have found an interest in cybersecurity after researching this technology and may consider a career in this field. Cybersecurity is a job that is continually growing and I personally want a job that has good growth, which is good. For me, I have never been involved in or fell victim to cyber crime, attack or terrorism, although my mother has to phishing which falls under cybercrime. She clicked on a link that depicted “click on this to win a car” or something along those lines and requests for her to input her email. This very example demonstrates that anybody, regardless of your age can fall victim to it if you are unaware of what phishing is. Subsequently, her email was spammed with ‘fishy’ links, most notably the “want to know how you can win millions”, and as a result, she chose to make a new email as she no longer wants to associate with it.</p>
