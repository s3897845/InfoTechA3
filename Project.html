							<h1>Project</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Project_ban.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<h2>Overview:</h2>
							<p>This project is a note-sharing application that allows groups of people to create and share important dates/events with different groups. The application will be supported on android and apple devices and will function as a note taking program for personal use as well as shared use with designated groups created by users. The app can function as a regular note taking app if the user desires, however there will be an option to allow users to create and join groups to share notes like a portable online notice board. There will be a login system where users can log into the app using facebook and google. This will be used to add friends and form groups. The application will also have an integrated calendar equipped with a notification system that alerts users of upcoming events shared by every member in the group. The Gregorian calendar design is directly linked to the note-sharing function where notes can be tagged into the designated date. For instance, if a group has a team project due on the 25th of May they can type it into the note and then proceed to set it as a reminder on the calendar .The app will be designed to cater towards group projects between colleagues as well as social groups that just need a form of communication.
							</p>

							<h2>Motivation:</h2>
							<p>Our group is designing this app because using regular social media apps such as instagram, facebook and twitter are inefficient when trying to effectively discuss and plan events with friends and colleagues. The project will be useful as it streamlines the process of planning and scheduling important events upcoming in the users life as well as in a corporate setting where many collaborators are working towards a single project. According to prnewswire.com a survey conducted by decluttr (an organization whose goal is to help declutter people's lives) stated that 78 percent of Americans have no idea what to do with their busy lifestyles. Therefore there is a huge market of potential users who could use this app to improve their already cluttered life. The solution to this problem also seems like a fun challenge to us as a group as designing an app has been a task we have all wanted to tackle as it seems like a fun and interactive learning experience. During us working on the assignment we found it hard to effectively communicate small ideas without having to organize a full meeting. Due to this we thought it would be very useful to many people to design an app that helps users organise their daily events on the go.
							</p>

							<h2>Description:</h2>
							<p>Upon opening the app users will be greeted with a login screen that allows them to login using google or facebook as well as an option to sign up using another email such as yahoo, bigpond etc. After logging in the user will be greeted with a home screen that displays notes, groups, calendar and profile which when clicked on will take them to different screens that display the information of whatever was pressed. For example tapping on the profile button will take the user to their personal profile where they can add/edit their profile picture, update their password and email as well as recovering their password and the ability to view friends and friend requests. The implementation of a profile is to promote friendliness with descriptions that can be added for personal touches as well as personal hobbies etc. Moving on to the note section of the app, the user can create, edit and delete notes for their own personal use. These will be marked with a recognizable “+” for creation and a “-” for deletion. Other features inside the note taking sections are folders for notes you may take to organise the notes in such a way where certain notes might be just normal text notes or ones that are set on the calendar as well as within groups. The notes not only support text but also images; image embedding; video embedding; location and drawing for flexibility when writing notes.  In the groups section there will be the feature to create a group using a “+”  which will then let you select the friends to add to the group note. There will also be a join button that will allow you to use a code to join a group as well as view invitations to group notes which the user can then accept or decline. Normally the group screen will have these two functions in the top right corner with the rest of the screen displaying the groups the user is currently involved in. Social aspects of the app will require an internet or cellular connection, such as updating your profile, posting a note to a group, adding friends, syncing updates. For both the personal and group notes there will be a button that allows the note written to be sent to a certain date in the calendar. Finally when the user clicks on the calendar section of the app, the user will be met with a gregorian calendar layout with all their upcoming events and plans which can then be accessed for more information by simply tapping on the event in question. The notes/events put into a calendar can be separated and made distinct through colour and titles with filtering features that include views (like in databases). The events inputted into the calendar will provide push notifications to the user’s phone if the user allows it, with options to set frequencies on reminders. The app will follow a minimalist approach with easy navigation using recognition over recall making it easy for the user to understand what they need to do in order to achieve their goals. Using all familiar icons that are basically conventions within apps right now. The colour scheme will also follow a minimalist design using calm colours in contrast to darker ones to really make the menus pop for the user, with only 3 tones of colour that can be changed through themes, excluding note colours. The goal of this app is to easily inform tasks and information to the users and between the users as well as the flexibility to view/note down information on the go. The flexibility of the application means that it can be implemented in many situations, such as personal, social and corporate settings. This allows for project management to be easily accessible on mobile devices for corporate users and event planning for a more social context. The main functions of this app include data sharing (i.e. sharing notes with groups), date and time integration (i.e. the calendar and its functions) as well as social services (i.e. profile and friends functions). These different functions were included into the design of the app due to the popularity and familiarity people have with these concepts, with this, the recognisability of the functions within our app help to appeal to multiple users varying in age.

							<h2>Tools and Tech:</h2>
							<p>We as a group chose proto.io to design the wireframe of the application, ensuring that it adheres to Nielsen’s usability heuristics and making sure that it improves user experience. Proto.io was chosen over figma, regardless of the two softwares being similar due to the straightforward nature, Proto.io will be used for prototyping as it has many preset features that are available when creating one, with a much more improved interface and the integrated icons such as a battery icon. For the programming language, we chose python mainly due to the increase in popularity it has been getting when programming for mobile applications. The reason for the sudden popularity is because of advancements in python code with implementations of better Graphic User Interface(GUI) when developing a mobile app and the use of third party libraries that can be added to python to aid in the process of development. These libraries also support operation on many operating systems, easing the process even further as python is already really accessible, well documented and has a low barrier of entry. For the development, it will be used on a windows computer with a dual core processor as it represents the threshold specifications of most phones allowing us to accurately measure the efficiency and speed of the application process. The entire project will be done on a computer, and set as a mobile only application.
							</p>

							<h2>Skills:</h2>
							<p>This project will require various IT-specific skills to ensure that the project is completed and functions as intended. Some of these skills include programming and the use. of Nielsen heuristics. Programming in python will be needed in order to develop the application and the various functions that are included. Python was chosen as all members of the group are familiar with the software and the terminology that ensues. The use of Nielsen heuristics learnt in our IT course will prove useful when designing the UI of the app. Keeping the UX (user experience) in mind we can use this skill to develop a good looking and easy to use app. The general skills in this project will require excellent organisation and communication, which will allow the team to achieve many goals and overcome many hurdles through discussions, cooperation and delegation of tasks. Creativity is also a necessary skill during the development of the application’s interface and feature as it will determine the outcome of the appeal that users will find during their experience.  Problem solving will be a crucial skill needed to overcome any problems that arise with the development of the app or the team itself. The skills listed above are an absolute must to create the best body of work possible.
							</p>

							<h2>Outcome:</h2>
							<p>If the project is successful the outcome will be an app that functions with zero bugs and issues. The users will be pleased and a good mark shall be received. The team will also feel a great sense of accomplishment on completion of the project as we would have just completed a task that means a lot to us. The original problem of peoples lives being too cluttered and busy will be solved, as our app would simplify the lives of our users through the streamlined process of adding notes to a calendar, keeping the user and the user’s groups up-to-date on what is going on with their lives. The impact of this development will definitely provide good experience to everyone in the team including project management and group work. More specifically understanding how to deal with other people and instruct them to get their work done (i.e. setting deadlines, delegating roles and constant updates on what everyone is doing and what they are up to). The outcome of this project, good or bad will be an invaluable experience to our team and will surely help us slowly get closer to our goal of graduating and becoming an IT expert in each of our own respected fields.
