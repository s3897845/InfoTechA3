							<h2>Cloud Services and Servers:</h2>

							<p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
							<p>Cloud, services and servers, they all have one thing in common. The internet. The internet is something we all use on a daily basis, whether you are working, posting pictures to social media, paying for groceries or playing games. Servers are what connects you to the internet or other servers around the world through networks. A server is any hardware device such as a computer or software that allows the transmission of requests from clients. Home servers allow different devices or clients to send and receive requests for things such as files, information about the system etc. Cloud computing is something that has only been introduced in the 1990â€™s, with its now mainstream capabilities and reliance on the technology it is hard to imagine its importance in the current climate in our daily lives. Cloud computing is a virtual space on the internet where people can rent out services such as IT infrastructure with multiple features included. On the other hand you can use a cloud service for a single function, so that there is no need for expensive and time consuming implementation of IT infrastructure for one function.
							</p>

							<p><b>What can be done now?</b></p>
							An example of this is networks and servers. While only the cream of the crop of corporations and companies can create major IT infrastructure for their operations of servers, networks, storage, processing, AI and virtualisation, most small to large businesses do not have the resources or time to invest into these technologies, let alone creating whole IT infrastructures. Cloud computing allows for smaller companies to rent a cloud computing service(s) so that their resources are not being wasted on extra costs into IT infrastructure as all the services can be provided through the cloud with minimal upkeep. Companies medium sized and up are able expand their businesses without much thought into a cloud based infrastructure as cloud services are scalable to almost no limits. The limits are decided by the provider of the cloud services as it runs on their hardware and platform as well as how much you are willing to pay. The main use of cloud computing in the current landscape is the renting of services such as server hosting, virtualisation, artificial intelligence, processing and storage. State of the art cloud computing technology utilises whole data centers for processing and creating platforms where generic users are able to access services that are normally inaccessible to them at rates where they only need to pay for what they use instead of investing into their own means to complete what they want. The use of quantum computation is currently being experimented on by major companies such as Google, Amazon and IBM, companies that also hold a monopoly on cloud computation services. Although there is still some time till quantum computation will be implemented on the more commercial side of cloud computing, these companies will experiment with the technology for the time being for things that can be used in the future for private or exclusive endeavours. These might be things like data processing of large scale, knowing how much these companies collect our information as well as computation of major processes as the reliance of cloud technologies increases.
 							</p>

							<p><b>What can be done in three years from now?</b></p>
							<p>Many technologies have been created before cloud computing became a viable option for  companies to take the risk and move their operations to a cloud based platform. Only recently have businesses and companies moved some of their operations to a cloud based platform, as over the years the ease of use as well as scalability of cloud services had major benefits to them. Cloud services are based off major data centers around the world and the internet, the connection between networks all around the world, creates an easy portal for users to access services provided by cloud services. Investments into high speed internet connections from developing countries as well as high speed virtualisation of machines such as computers and servers, allows for cloud computing to be a viable option. </p>

							<p><b>What is the likely impact of this?</p></b>
							<p>The development of cloud computing and its services have changed the present day businesses already and is proving to be cost effective as well as relatively simple to set up as companies who supply cloud services have streamlined the process. Making it extremely easy to move certain operations over onto the cloud or to be fully operational over the cloud. This means the future of businesses are pretty bright although there is a possibility of over saturation, meaning more wasted resources such as materials and technology. The commercialisation of cloud services have their downsides as well, such as a less personalised and more general approach to delivering the each service meaning some operations might be not as effective as a standalone implementation. The reliance on these cloud services also mean having to follow set terms and conditions of use, but more importantly the reliance also means stress on the service to be running at all times. The cloud service providers have to upkeep their data centres and servers indefinitely, which creates a problem where if the cloud service goes down, it cannot be fixed on demand and relies on a third party. Most people will benefit from cloud services as there are a range of services that can be useful for almost all users. The simplest being cloud storage which any of us use, just normal people. On the flipside however, in the professional realm of things, a person will be able to virtualise machines for the cloud to run certain programs or processes in a more public scenario. In more private scenarios, businesses, companies and corporations will use cloud services for storing and processing data, borrowing servers to connect gamers across the world, deploying API's, etc. Cloud computing and its services are slowly making many technologies obsolete due to the vast amount of things you can complete on it, without the actual technology to do so.
							</p>

							<p><b>How will this affect you?</p></b>
							<p>Cloud computing has already changed the way that I personally work on a daily basis, as I use many cloud services for data storage of important documents and more importantly writing up documents on Google Docs on Google's cloud service. Google has a suite of office applications on the Web, where Docs is a word processor based on Google's cloud platform with connections to their own storage service Google Drive. Cloud computation has already been a big part of my life and will soon become an even bigger part as more services will be accessible to me, when I decide to take up on bigger endeavours such as data processing, virtualisation and completing complex tasks such as creating neural networks in pattern detection.
							</p>

							<p><b>How will this affect your family and friends?</p></b>
							<p>Usually a well equipped PC will be able to complete most modern tasks, but when on the go, the use of more portable devices such as laptops or even mobile phones. Cloud computing will enable people to complete even the most demanding computations required by the user on the go. As the technology continues to progress, cloud computing will prove useful to future technological advancements where family and friends will integrate more of their lives with cloud services, for plain simplicity and ease of use. My family in particular will see benefits such as better storage photos and documents as they have been using physical drives and nand as a place to store these things, risking failure of drives, corruption of files and a manual backup that is usually overlooked. Cloud computation is also great for collaboration between friends and colleagues as the existence of the cloud means that there are many ways for people to connect to each other. This will happen because of the prevalence of technology in this day and age, where more of the world gets surrounded by technology and the benefits of cloud computing are yet to shine.
