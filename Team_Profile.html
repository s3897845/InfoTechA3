							<p><img src="images/Jesse.jpeg" alt="alt text" width=150 height="200" style="float: right"> My name is Jesse Doolan (student number: s3897845) I come from an Australian background. I grew up in Melbourne, Victoria and attended St. John Bosco’s primary school, St. Bernards secondary college and currently RMIT university. My hobbies are skating, playing guitar/making music and of course I.T (i.e. Coding, playing games, building computers). My IT interests are gaming, hardware and coding. I love taking apart and putting together computers for fun and I love the challenge that coding provides to me. I have been using computers since i was 4 years old and have been coding since I was 14. I love the world of IT and everything about it. <br> <b>Website: </b><a href="https://s3897845.github.io/InfoTechWebsite/">https://s3897845.github.io/InfoTechWebsite/ </a></p>

							<p><img src="images/Jordan.jpeg" alt="alt text" width=150 height="200" style="float: left"> My name is Jordan Ngo, I am Vietnamese, born in Carlton, Victoria. I went to 4 different schools growing up, finishing high school at Point Cook Senior Secondary College. I am currently in my first year at RMIT studying Information Technology and my hobbies/interests are games, anime/manga, soccer, cycling (mainly track/fixie cycling) and computers. My main interests in computers are games and game development, cloud computing and networks as well as programming. These interests sparked during my teens, when I was introduced to computer gaming from my cousin and my family had bought a laptop. I spent most of my time learning more about computers through the laptop, and finally building my own computer at 15 years old. Since then, I have built around 5 PC’s for family and friends as it's something I can introduce them to and teach about, sharing my love for computers with others.

I am of a Chinese background and grew up in Melbourne, Victoria. I attended Mackellar primary school, Copperfield College Delahey and currently RMIT university. My hobbies are mostly playing games and watching anime, hence, being around computers for almost the whole day everyday made me have more interest in IT. This is the reason why I chose to study a career in the IT field. <br> <b>Website: </b><a href="https://jameslay2002.github.io/My-Project/">https://jameslay2002.github.io/My-Project/ </a></p>

							<h2>Myers-Briggs Test:</h2>
							<p>The myers-briggs test revealed that 3 out of the 4 of us are more introverted than extroverted and are more prone to examine and observe others' behaviours. This information is helpful because it allows us as a group to understand that we need to speak up more to communicate better and improve workflow. All of the team members think logically and don't react impulsively therefore we can come to conclusions with ease and little to no arguments. </p>

							<h2>Learning Style Test:</h2>
							<p>Three of our team members are visual learners and one is an auditory learner, knowing this allows us as a team to understand how each other learns and how to go about delegating roles and instructing each other. For example in our meetings we know to provide visuals for those of us who are visual learners (Sharing screens showing assignment sheets, current work etc.) </p>

							<h2>Third Learning Test of Choice:</h2>
							<p>These different tests were hard to compare and contrast with each other as each team member completed a different test. However the results of these various tests only reinforced the outcomes that the last two tests provided, this being that most of our group are logical introverted thinkers with one team member being an extroverted logical observer. </p>
