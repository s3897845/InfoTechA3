							<h1>IT Work</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Work_ban.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Background Info:</h2>

							<p>Our team conducted an interview via email with an IT profesional here are the answers to the questions we asked</p>


							<h2>1) Please tell me about your IT work. What exactly did you do?</h2>

							<p>I started off as a Graduate Programmer at the NAB where I was given a program proposal which pretty much outlined specifications of what program was needed and the functions they wanted it to have.  From here I wrote the program.  Once written I needed to test the program on all aspects where it could possibly fall over and then have a way to manage the error, whether it be with an error message (eg. if somebody entered incorrect data into a field they needed to fill in), or whether it be to iron out any bugs that seemed to show up or work incorrectly.  In order to do this, a testing document with every possible test case you could think of would have to be written.  Once this was completed and fully tested, it was all handed over to the Systems analyst in order to be integrated into the bigger picture (these programs were only small sections of big systems).  After 2 years of doing this, I went on to be a Systems Analyst which was more involved in the designing and liaising with the client - usually from another section of the Bank.  Systems Analysts actually write the program proposal and the programmers code and test it.  Then I went on to Lead Analyst Programmer where I designed systems and had a  team of SA and Programmers under me who did the above.
							</p>

							<h2>2) Please tell me about the industry you worked in?</h2>
							<p>I worked at the NAB in the Technology department therefore all programs and systems that were designed were pretty much internal to other areas of the bank.	</p>


							<h2>3) What other kinds of work did you complete in your department? </h2>
							<p>Apart from what I explained in question 1, I also did some work in the Support Team. In this area you are basically called at any time of day or night if a system has fallen over eg. The ATM  system is down.  I would go into work and rerun the jobs and find the problem. Pretty much debugging on a bigger scale.</p>

							<h2>4) What kinds of people did you interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? </h2>
							<p>I interacted with Programmers, Analyst Programmers, Senior Analyst Programmers, Lead Analyst Programmers in my team and in other teams especially if both our systems were connected and needed to work together.  the client was internal - other areas of the bank ie. Collections was one system that I worked on therefore had to work with the collections team which were at a different location but still within the NAB.</p>

							<h2>5) What aspects of your work did you spend most time on? Why?</h2>
							<p> Most time was spent on testing.  The coding was very much following protocols.  Once you know one programming language you can apply the foundations to work your way around most others.  Testing is time consuming and needs to cover every possible scenario so writing test cases and the document was probably what most time was spent on.</p>

							<h2>6) What aspect of your position was most challenging? </h2>
							<p>I went into my job at a time where the field was male dominated therefore the hardest was getting used to this more than anything.  As for the actual work, as with anything that is team oriented it is making sure that the team works well together because one person's work ties in with the others therefore you always need to be on the same page.</p>

							<h2>7) Why did you decide to go into this line of work? </h2>
							<p>When trying to decide what to do after high school I looked into job prospects once uni would be finished and technology was the main one therefore I knew I would find a good, stable job that paid well, pretty quickly.  Also there are a lot of different areas you can go with it so I knew I had options.</p>

							<h2>8) Were there things that you did not enjoy about your work? Why? </h2>
							<p>I didn't enjoy getting woken up at 3am to go into the city because a system had fallen over.  it was difficult and once I was married I chose not to do that anymore. The support team is more of a lifestyle and it wasn't fitting in. The only other thing would've been when there are errors that nobody can fix so you are there forever trying to work it out. Not for the faint hearted. Other than that, I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with.</p>

							<h2>9) What aspects of your work did you enjoy the most? Why? </h2>
							<p>The satisfaction of testing and completing a system and it all working perfectly, handed over and you see it working in the bank and where it fits in. Nothing beats that sense of pride and accomplishment.</p>

							<h2>10) Finally, can you share an example of your work that best captures the essence of the IT industry? </h2>
							<p>An example of the work I did at NAB was debugging, constantly running into programs very much sums up the IT industry in a nutshell. Not a day went by when something didn't go wrong, with some system or program always having some issues. it's frustrating work but it has its rewards.</p>
