							<h2>Jesse:</h2>
							<p>I think as a group we have worked fairly well throughout the milestone 2 assessment. I believe our communication and delegation of roles went really well once we actually started getting along with the assignment, we regularly set up meetings after school hours and effectively discussed our issues and deadlines to ensure that our assignment was completed on time. I think we should have started our assignment earlier as when it came to the final submission we were running out of time. One thing that was surprising was everyone's willingness to get work done and attend meetings, I thought that for sure at least someone would have been the weak link in the group. One thing I have learnt about groups is that setting deadlines are a must if you want work done. I found that if deadlines were not set then no work would be completed in a timely manner. Our github log of activity does not represent our work on this assignment at all; it was completely underused and we need to take these things into consideration more for future assignments to come. Overall I believe the group worked well together but failed to understand the level of skill required to complete this task.
							</p>

							<h2>Minh:</h2>
							<p> I think this group has good teamwork and worked well over the assignment as we were able to follow up with our plans and all contribute to our work as well as having meetings often over the week. However the main problem was our lack of initiative and awareness for the level of work our assignment required, we should have started the assignment at a much earlier time to prevent the overload of work that needs to be done. Communication outside of meetings was also a problem as it was not used often to follow up on tasks that needed to be done sooner. Overall this group is capable of working together but lacked the proper initiative and organisation of the assignment.</p>

							<h2>James:</h2>
							<p>Personally, I think the group worked well together for the milestone 2 assessment. Communication was mainly well for most of us as well, often having meetings during our free time and we were always punctual. Although, we underestimated the amount of work that the assessment had, setting most of it back two weeks before the due date to work on it. Regardless, we worked hard to get tasks done, delegating work to individual members of the group in order to stay back on track again. Ultimately, I believe we strived hard in the end to accomplish it but we should have managed our time more efficiently rather than doing a “last second” job. </p>

							<h2>Jordan:</h2>
							<p>As a group, I believe that our team has risen up to the challenges that faced us in this assignment, getting to know each other a lot more on the way. The assignment was quite a test for our group as during the start we were oblivious to the assignment’s fast approaching deadline. After proper talks within our group, realising the predicament we were in, our focus changed to swiftly dealing with the delegating tasks and working out and problems in the group. Our group has great communication, with almost any questions or worries subdued by our members. One issue that was highlighted during a practical we had was the quality of our work. This was a pretty big wake up call that immediately needed action within the group. Discussions we had over social media and Microsoft Teams were crucial to the success of our group, clarifying the intentions as well as standards of our work. Although we did have some sketchy moments such as setting deadlines for ourselves and such, some of us were unable to meet them, the expectations of our peers were not being met. Working as a group was a strong point for us as we tend to get things done more efficiently as well as help our peers when working together. On the other hand, work that was delegated to each member was completed in a less stylish fashion, fashionably late that was, but still completed to a point where it was satisfactory to the group. The assignment had started out rough, but one we got into the groove, the group worked really well with efforts and encouragement from all our members.
							</p>

							<h2>Team Reflection:</h2>
							<p> After getting together as a group it has come to the attention of all group members that we have worked well together but have underestimated the expected level and quality of work that we have been tasked with. Although we have done well to frequently meet and discuss further plans and jobs we as a group have noticed that we are very much racing against time to get the assignment done. Due to the limited time we had to complete this assignment we successfully and efficiently delegated roles and set deadlines to ensure that we could complete the task on time. There was no conflict within the group, handling all communications effectively through the use of social media, then unfolding into group meetings in Microsoft teams to further discuss and devise future plans. If not for our thorough group discussions many tasks such as the project idea, industry data and website would certainly fail or at the very least would not be up to the standard required. The quality of work expected of our group was something that came to our attention, and made us realise that we needed to up our standard if we wanted to achieve what was expected of us. This was essential for smooth cooperation and completion of work with similar ideas and quality in mind when developing our own answers in relation to the task. A huge flaw we had as a group was that we had a rocky start. As mentioned early we started the assignment late but as a side effect of this we agree that our communication was absolutely atrocious, no one knew what was happening and it led to many misunderstandings about our project and where our assignment as a whole was heading. One other thing was we were very lax and didn’t show any initiative or interest in our upcoming assignment. We also just did bits and pieces of work without letting anyone know leading to people doing work that was already done. We also initially had problems settling on a project idea due to people in the group being afraid to speak their mind which caused minor problems when it came to creating the project idea. Even after settling on a project idea we still had issues speaking up about what we wanted to be accomplished from this project. However through these failures our group has really become a well oiled machine where we are all happy with what we have achieved.
