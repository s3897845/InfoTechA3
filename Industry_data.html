							<h2>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
							<p>The job titles for our teams ideal jobs are Database administrator, Cyber security architect, IT manager/coordinator and Network architect. Each of these jobs have a variety of different skill sets therefore it is hard to rank these jobs, however according to CIO.com the highest job in demand is a security professional (Cybersecurity architect and IT Manager) then database administrator and then lastly a network architect/administrator. Despite the rankings of these jobs, these professions are all in a high demand and still pay well making each of these ideal jobs a great goal to try and achieve in the future.</p>

							<h2>Group skill sets:</h2>
							<p><b>General skills:</b> <br>- Excellent written and verbal communication<br>- Problem solving <br>- Analysing, documenting and reporting <br>- Organisation, planning and scheduling
<br>- Leadership and delegation</p>

							<p><b>IT specfic skills:</b> <br>- Python, Javascript, C++, SQL <br>- Project management <br>- Understanding of an IT system <br>- Extensive understanding of each respective job’s technology (e.g security, protocols, etc.)
 <br>- Experience with implementation</p>

 							<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
 							<p>The IT-specific skill set of our group does meet certain demands from employers such as programming language which is considered essential in the IT industry. Programming languages and management are the most popular skills to have. Aside from programming languages there are a lot of skills related to a high sophisticated understanding of maintaining various systems and architectures such as networks, firewalls, wireless systems and desktops that can only be obtained through years of real work experience in the IT world. Overall a ranking would be the ability to code then understanding of IT systems and then project management.</p>

							<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
							<p>JAVA, Microsoft Windows, project management and SAP which are all software related fields not found in our group’s ideal skill sets. JAVA is a  highly sought after IT skill that is useful in most operating systems as JAVA runs on its own virtual machine in order to talk to the hardware. JAVA is written in a high level language and then compiled to run on its own, in comparison to javascript which is an interpretive language which compiles as the program is run. With the ever growing market of computers, especially in the present day landscape where working at home has become a mainstay in office related work. Many of these users will be on the Windows operating systems as the windows market share is around 87% against Mac OS, Linux, Chrome OS and others, meaning that being proficient in windows related skills are crucial. As for SAP, an abbreviation for Systems Applications and Products within Enterprise Resource Planning. It is not only a centralised system that connects all departments of a company together but helps the communication, providing information and reducing redundancies and  duplication between these departments. It makes all processes within a company more efficient and productive and that in itself is self explanatory for why skills within SAP is an extremely in demand skill.</p>

							<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
							<p>Team-work is important in order to fulfill a company’s objective. Communication will need to be clear as a result along with the teamwork. Creativity is essential to provide solutions to queries or problems and to create new opportunities. Having a strong sense of creativity is the reason why large companies always surprise consumers with amazing ideas. Time-management is defining a time period and to successfully achieve the task given as well as effectively organising your time. These general skills are not within our required skill sets but all interconnect within each other. </p>

							<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
							<p><b>James:</b> Burning glass states that the top IT skills in greatest demand is SQL, which is similar to my ideal job of using SQL to manage data in a relational database management system. However, as a person who is mostly introverted and with communication skills being the highest ranked general skill has affected my opinion of my ideal job. Furthermore, I have learnt to dislike employing SQL, and as burning glass stated that SQL is in high demand in many jobs has greatly shifted my opinion of my ideal job to the point where I want to change. </p>

							<p><b>Minh:</b> The burning glass data accurately depicts what is to be expected from my ideal job, especially having extensive knowledge in many parts of the IT field related to security such as the method, technicality and organisation; Most of the top skills in demand fall under these three categories. My opinion has not changed about the role I’m looking forward to since it is a senior role among the IT hierarchy. </p>

							<p><b>Jesse:</b> The burning glass data has not changed my opinion on my ideal job. The reason being is that despite some of the IT-specific skills that are high in demand (such as SQL etc.) catching me off guard, my ideal job is relatively unaffected by the data presented, the skills needed are in demand as much if not more than I expected and the job demand itself has not surprised me. I think even if the demand for my job was low or something else I liked was higher I would not change my opinion on my ideal job because in the end in my eyes any job in IT is in demand one way or the other so I am not worried. </p>

							<p><b>Jordan:</b> The skills whether general or IT specific, the skills that are most in demand as shown by the burning glass data has not changed my opinion on the ideal job I hope for. As more and more devices rely on internet services, the importance of networks not only at home, but in businesses are becoming more of a priority. Skills that are in demand such as SQL, JAVA and SAP, while in demand is not the end all be all of required skills. Services such as a home network, cloud computing, working from home all benefit from skills related and relevant to my ideal job, a Network Architect. Job satisfaction is also an important factor to me, where networks are something I want to work with for a long time as I really look forward to it. </p>
