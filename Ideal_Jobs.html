							<h2>Statement:</h2>

							<p>Comparing each team member's ideal job has led us to the conclusion that each one of us wants to work in a different field of IT. Whether its database management, cybersecurity or networking everyone in the team has different goals and objectives they are wishing to achieve from this course. The similarities between some of our ideal jobs is that there is a shared interest in coding as well as maintaining/improving systems such as databases security software etc. The differences are abundant because all team members want to do different jobs in the future. For example one member wants to only maintain databases and code queries for them whereas other members want to be in a position of power where they overlook their own team and manage multiple projects instead of one. Other members also want to take a more project management role. As stated earlier all of our team members' plans are completely different with different interests and motivations behind them however with this information the whole team can still find a middle ground through our love for IT.
